# My Projects

Here is some of the simple projects I have done:

Alert Website Test: The Alert Website Test has different buttons that perform different functions, like turning alerts "on and off". It's just a test, so all it does is pop up little windows on the top of your screen.

Calculator: A simple webpage with a calculator that has options to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

Click Counter: Tests how many clicks you have done, you can click to add more numbers and click to take away more numbers.

Coding Quiz: A quiz created to test someones coding knowledge, there is a timer too but it's sort of broken.

Countdown Timer: A timer that counts down.

Dogs Project: A website all about dogs. The website includes a background as an image, music & a section for games.

Pokemon: A wepbage made for "Carl" and about his Pokemon. The website describes the creatures' skill set and includes games and music as well. Background images and colored nav bars are also featured to match the theme as well.

Early Website Test: There used to be a better version of this website with images and more, but it got lost, so this is the early version.

Gif Generator: Generates gifs with a search bar.

Iteration Arrays: Uses the console.

Iteration Arrays v2: Different version of the previous project.

Slytherin Webpage: A webpage about Harry Potter, specifically the Slytherin group. It has information about the people and spells used.
