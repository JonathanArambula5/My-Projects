# My Projects

Here is some of the projects I have done:

Alert Website Test: The Alert Website Test has different buttons that perform different functions, like turning alerts "on and off". It's just a test, so all it does is pop up little windows on the top of your screen.

Calculator: A simple webpage with a calculator that has options to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

Click Counter: Tests how many clicks you have done, you can click to add more numbers and click to take away more numbers.

Coding Quiz: A quiz created to test someones coding knowledge, there is a timer too but it's sort of broken.

Countdown Timer: A timer that counts down.

Early Website Test: There used to be a better version of this website with images and more, but it got lost, so this is the early version.

Gif Generator: Generates gifs with a search bar.

Iteration Arrays: Uses the console.

Iteration Arrays v2: Different version of the previous project.

Slytherin Webpage: A webpage about Harry Potter, specifically the Slytherin group. It has information about the people and spells used.
